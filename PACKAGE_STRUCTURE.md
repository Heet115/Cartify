# Cartify - Organized Package Structure

## Overview
The Cartify Android app package structure has been organized into logical groupings for better maintainability and code organization.

## Changes Made

### 1. Activity Organization
- **Authentication Activities**: `LoginActivity` and `RegisterActivity` moved to `activities.auth` package
- **Main Activities**: `MainActivity` and `SplashActivity` moved to `activities.main` package  
- **Product Activities**: `ProductDetailActivity` and `SearchActivity` moved to `activities.product` package
- **Cart Activities**: `CartActivity` moved to `activities.cart` package
- **Order Activities**: `OrdersActivity`, `OrderDetailActivity`, and `OrderConfirmationActivity` moved to `activities.order` package
- **User Activities**: `ProfileActivity` moved to `activities.user` package

### 2. Package Declaration Updates
- Updated package declarations in all moved activity files
- Added necessary import statements for cross-package references
- Updated AndroidManifest.xml activity declarations to reflect new package structure

### 3. Import Statement Updates
- Updated imports in all activities to reference the new package locations
- Updated adapter imports to reference moved activities
- Added R class imports where needed

### 4. AndroidManifest.xml Updates
- Updated all activity declarations to use new package paths
- Maintained parent activity relationships with updated paths

## Benefits of This Organization

1. **Better Code Organization**: Activities are grouped by functionality making it easier to locate and maintain code
2. **Improved Scalability**: New activities can be easily added to appropriate packages
3. **Enhanced Readability**: Package structure clearly indicates the purpose of each activity
4. **Easier Navigation**: Developers can quickly find related activities in the same package
5. **Better Separation of Concerns**: Each package has a specific responsibility

## Package Responsibilities

- **activities.auth**: User authentication and registration
- **activities.main**: Core app functionality and splash screen
- **activities.product**: Product browsing and search functionality
- **activities.cart**: Shopping cart management
- **activities.order**: Order processing and history
- **activities.user**: User profile and account management
- **adapters**: RecyclerView adapters for displaying lists
- **models**: Data model classes representing app entities
- **utils**: Helper classes and utilities used across the app

This organized structure follows Android development best practices and makes the codebase more maintainable and scalable.
